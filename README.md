# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Jigsaw-Academy-Google-reviews
This repository_contains ipynb file in which I have made machine learning models that classify google reviews into positive or negative class.
Aim - To make Sentiment Analysis model that can classify the google reviews into positive or negative classes based on the review.

Description - Labeled reviews which are having ratings greater than 2 as positive and reviews that are having ratings at most 2 as negative. Then, made the VADER model and ROBERTA model which can classify reviews into positive or negative depending upon the sentiments. After that, I evaluated the performance of both the models by classification report that I made by labels and predicted values. Finally, I gave the reasons about when we can use which model.

Task Carried out during these projects
1. Data Loading
2. Basic EDA
3. Model building
4. Model Evaluation
5. Conclusion

These models will help the organization in the following way:

- It is extremely important for any organization to analyze its performance and see how its customers are feeling about them.
- However, it is not feasible for any organization to perform this task manually. So my models can perform this task automatically. 
- So these machine learning models will help organization to classify reviews into positive or negative classes, which will help organizations see how they are performing in the market and help them to improve their performance where needed.
- This will help the organization to analyze their customers which will lead to satisfying their customers thoroughly so that they can make a better market reputation for themselves which will lead to better business.

Skills Developed - Text analytics and Natural Language Processing, VADER model, RoBERTa model, model evaluation.
