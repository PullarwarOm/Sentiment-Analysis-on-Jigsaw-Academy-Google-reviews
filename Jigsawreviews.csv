Shreyasi Mahurkar,"I was enrolled in Integrated Program in Business Analytics from Jigsaw Academy and IIM Indore and the program was very well structured and I got to learn analytics right from the basics to the advanced level. The introduction of Kaggle competitions right from my batch (batch 9) helped me apply all the theoretical and practical knowledge which I have gained via case studies to actual real world problem statements. The videos and the study material provided by Jigsaw explains everything in a simple yet exciting way which helps in easy understanding. All the faculty who taught us were good and had a good years of experience in the field. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to start his analytics career afresh.
Special thanks to Moses for quickly resolving all the queries, and for all the support. He is one of the main reasons why I have rated 5 stars to this course :)",5

The support that Jigsaw provided through out the course, whether you talk about extra classes for the topics which were not clear to people or any other thing related access/study material, onboarding etc. has been awesome. The faculties were good and were very supportive as well.

sujith david,I came across this course related to Product Management conducted by Jigsaw which I found to be the right one to upskill my career. I was impressed with the curriculum and the vast areas that it covers under product management. The course schedule and the timings were apt for me considering I work during the weekdays.

Vijay Hande,"I am happy to share that I graduated and secured 3rd rank from Batch 7 of the Integrated Program in Business Analytics (IPBA) course offered by Jigsaw Academy, in partnership with IIM Indore.

It turned out to be a great learning experience, with classes being conducted online every weekend, by certain amazing lecturers from both IIM Indore and Jigsaw Academy as well.

What I loved the best about class lectures is that, even though there were students from various backgrounds (some with good hands-on technical knowledge, some with no technical background, some with great experience, and some with none, etc.), the lecturers patiently addressed the doubts, and almost brought us all on the same level, irrespective of our technical backgrounds.

This program experience would be incomplete without mentioning special thanks to Mr. Moses Kola, who has been a fantastic student coordinator and a good mentor too. He is the go-to man for all course-related queries, and seemed to resolve multiple queries from various people with good patience. I myself have reached out to him with around 10-15 queries at least during various stages in the course, and he has been diligent enough to resolve each one of them in such quick time.

Will gladly recommend this program to those who are looking to bring themselves up to speed with the skills required in the Data Science and Analytics domain.",5
Sandipan Ghosh,"I enrolled for the Integrated Program In Business Analytics (IPBA) course. This course gives a great understanding of different fields in Business analytics and their applications. Faculty were good and the Jigsaw portal videos make things really simple.  Project coordinator - Moses, as well as other support team are quick to provide any help required. The best is the final project where in you are required to bring your own project. This gives the opportunity to work on your area of expertise.",5

My heartfelt regards to the Board of Jigsaw Academy and also to Mr. Shabeer who were very kind enough in giving an extension along with adding two more excellent programs FS ML and AI. My faculty Ms. Nityalakshmi who is very knowledgeable, approachable and resourceful was of a great support in clearing my doubts and helping me move on to the next higher level. My course coordinator was Ms Reshma  Iyer and she rendered her continuous support throughout my journey till scheduling of my viva and final certification. Thank you maam. :-).  Ms Hemalatha and Ms. Sharon helped in projecting the tickets raised to the concerned department and in the feedback process.

Deepak Upadhyay,"The IIM-Indore and Jigsaw - Integrated Program in Business Analytics (IPBA) is overall a very good program for those who want to acquire skills in and around domain of Data Science.

The online classes are over weekends followed with own self-study during weekdays and then getting ready for graded exams and projects. If you are thinking for getting enroll, it’s a yearlong commitment which is required. I took up this challenge, for me it was going back to full fledge dedicated learning after 15 years of my post-graduation. I am happy that I have completed this, got to learn a lot, now waiting for overall result and convocation at IIM-Indore.

About the course, my views
•	Curriculum Content – cover what is relevant in today’s business world, statistics, R, SQL, Python, ML, Tabalue etc.  I see people around me using all of these to perform day to day job at work and see increasing application of such tools.

•	Faculty – you will have both IIM-Indore and Jigsaw faculty taking up the topics. Its team of great professors who will impart their knowledge to you and will be available for assistance as well. Here, self-learning is equally important, before any new topic starts its advisable to go thru the Jigsaw videos, given few topics will be new to everyone.

•	Learning Experience – for me being a Chartered Accountant (CA) by profession, statistics was what I had learned previously but need revision. I had reservation on technical soundness, but the course starts from basic of each language (R, Python, SQL), of course you need practice but its manageable.  Given the course has been now completed, I can reasonably say that a non-tech guy can even do coding.

•	Kaggle Competition - we were lucky that Kaggle as a platform was introduced from our batch for project submission and assignments. Trust me, much of our learning happened and conceptual understanding was put to test when we were working on solving all such use cases.

•	Admin Support - You have good support team, Moses and team is there who will assist you during the entire engagement. Thank you for all your support with timely updates of live class content, weekly class notification, open house etc. I would also like to thank the management for their kindness as due to reasons beyond control I had to shift my batch and my request was accepted.

•	Batchmate / Learners – you connect with other learners who like you are there to acquire new skills to enable them grow both personally and professionally. Getting to connect with likeminded people make you learn and unlearn lot of things.

•	Placement – I didn’t opt for this, so cannot comment much. However, they do keep sending you notification of all opening in the market and it starts from the day you join the course.

•	BYOP – the last leg, is to submit your capstone project, it’s a group project to be submitted. As a group you need to get your project the domain you want to focus upon and the apply all your learning / knowledge gained.

Overall a great program to be part of, if you keen to learn new things and explore areas in the domain of Data Science.  Worth investing in yourself, get new skills relevant in current business environment.",5
Nishant Sharma,"I joined Integrated Program in Business Analytics which is a course provided by IIM Indore through Jigsaw. I feel this is one of the best course currently present if you are looking to make your career in the field of business analytics/data analytics. The faculties present are experienced and knowledgeable that help you learn even the smallest of the things.

This course is not just for a tech background person but if you are from non tech background like me, you can easily learn everything. As everything start from the basics and then they go deep into that subject. Iwould higly recommend this course to anyone looking to grow his/her career in the field of business analytics.",5
Anjali Pathak,"I am currently pursuing Product Management course from Jigsaw Academy in collaboration with IIM Indore.

Bhagyashree Ghosh Vlogs,"I am a Jigsaw Alumini. I can assure you that Jigsaw led courses are going to change your life. I have successfully shifted by career to Data Science from a glamorous English teaching career with Unacademy. This major career transformation was only possible because of Jigsaw Academy's tie-up with IIM Indore and provided the IPBA course. Academically I am a Commerce person and career was in English, no prior experience with codes and softwares. In the IPBA Course we were handholded from start by our mentors who were from Jigsaw and IIM Indore both. I would specially thank our coordinator Moses sir who made the online classess, interactions and communications seemless. Doubts were solved in real-time and job avenues are endless. Jigsaw has a robust placement support. I am personally a member of the Placement Comittee of my IPBA-9 Batch and I know how robust the efforts are. Many of our batchmates are places and we are still working to bring opportunities. If you are a Jigsaw Alumini you can always reach out to Jigsaw for placements and career change. After-course-completion services are a major advantage. I thank Jigsaw to the core of my heart to help me upskill and make me switch my career boldly.",5
Manoj Jain,"I had signed up for their FSDS (full stack data science) course in Mar '21 and had a year's time to complete the course, but sort of abandoned it after a couple of months mostly because of the instructor's failure to make the weekend classes interesting enough to sustain motivation.
However, sometime around Feb '22 I decided to give the course another chance, this time depending solely upon the online content (and Google as a backup!), and I discovered that it was possible to complete the course if one put in some dedicated and sustained effort . . .
And the reason for writing the review is to praise the support team at Jigsaw, which was very supportive, responded to all queries promptly, and granted two extensions to me to complete the course without charging any extra fees.",4
kumari anjali,"I have had the pleasure of doing an Integrated Program in Business Analytics at Jigsaw in partnership with IIM Indore. I had a wonderful learning experience in the past 10 months.

Kiran Kumar,"I recently completed my IIM Indore - Jigsaw IPBA program. I must say it has been an eye-opener for me. My experience has been excellent. The curriculum is relevant, detail-oriented and fast-paced. Faculty from Jigsaw and IIM Indore is great. Some topics may get confusing in the  beginning but the faculty genuinely want to make sure one gets the fundamentals clear. Project Coordinator - Moses has been extremely supportive in responding to student requests and queries - timely, prompt and effective. Overall a great program and anyone enrolling must keep atleast 8-10 hrs a week aside for pre-class prep to make the most out of this wonderful course !",4
Rahul O,"I usually check reviews before making the decision.  And hence I feel obliged to help others as well.  I chose Jigsaw Academy for my learning after going through reviews and talking with some of my friends.  So far, it has been a great experience overall.  I was looking for a Sales related program that can add value to my knowledge, skill sets and also resume.  I found one that fit my needs - Executive Programme in Strategic Sales Management by IIM Indore and Jigsaw Academy.  My entire experience over the past 8 months since I first started interacting with them has been excellent.  Initially I got complete information from Aditya from Jigsaw.  Later, once admission was completed, Rahul Moses really supported and helped all of us with all the required resources.  We had a great introduction and comprehensive sessions by the Program Director.  all the classes - both from Jigsaw and from IIM Indore were excellent.  Reason is - with the limited time we had - they all provided optimum knowledge and skill share that was possible.  Initially I had issues with the finance aspect, luckily I could arrange.  And now as it ends, I confirm, it was an excellent overall experience.  It is good that the team is very honest, clear, transparent about what all benefits we get and all of these are met.  So, in case you are a student, please do consider this a vote of confidence from my end, do get full information and decide.  Thanks to Jigsaw.",5
Varun Rajshekar,"IIM-Indore and Jigsaw Academy – Post Graduation in Product Management as a whole was very good. The examples, case studies and instruction were all excellent. The course did a good job of covering a lot of material in the time allotted. I found that each of the sessions gave great information and was very interactive.

This 6-month structured course was better then what I could have ever imagined and it did really help me to upskill. BYOP feature helped me gain a realistic & holistic exposure to the life of a Product Manager.

Overall, I am so happy I chose this course and Jigsaw academy’s staff is wonderful too.

Syed Shaheed and Irshad did a great job by supporting me with all the queries and sending across the study materials.",4
Karthik Sriram,"Big Looters . Poor quality training. I joined jigsaw datascience course at 40k . Syllabus is very poor that I don't know earlier . Only after few months I come to know many good courses available at better praise. Please stay away from jigsaw.

Edit after the jigsaw reply.
I am not happy with your reply . You people should have designed course properly that every concept is taught in each language since I pay the hefty amount.

I was told I can choose any language python, r and sas or I can pay 40k for all language course.

Now u people tells I completed only one Language  python I m not eligible for interview. Python is the great Language.",1
CHETHAN KUMAR,"I have enrolled for Full Stack Data Science Program (FSDS), Initially, I was bit worried about coding and stuff since am from non technical background.

I specially thank all the Jigsaw faculties who helped me in FSDS certification. Thank you.",4

Karthik Kanderi,"Excellent course. I’ve Persuaded IPBA from IIM Indore In collaboration with Jigsaw Academy. This is the BEST course I've taken so far in my career - or any other online platform for that matter. I appreciate the care taken to script each of the Concepts and brilliance of the IIM professors & Jigsaw Faculty who kept us engaged throughout the course. I started it being a bit sceptical, just with the intention to go quickly through some video scripts. but I changed my mind. There is so much to learn from the course. Special thanks to Professors Pritam Ranjan, Jitendra Manwani & Dr. Raghuram who are pioneers in their respective subjects & excellent at delivering the best . Altogether it was a great learning experience and I would recommend that if you want to learn analytics.

Three cheers to Jigsaw and IIM Indore. Special thanks to all faculties. 🙏❤️",5
Amrit Dash,"I want to say that my continued experience with Jigsaw Academy was and is nothing short of well rounded and complete.
The course material is organised into easy and quickly graspable modules. The underlying approach is very very intuitive and requires
minimum book work and optimum knowledge. Also the material is  shaped into videos so that you get the concepts better and do not have to spend time doing the background work.

Especially the Support is just too fantastic and awesome. They have a dedicated Tech Support team that help you out with the LMS access, sending across the Analytics datasets and code snippets, also giving dedicated one to one support for software installation, renewing course access, and a host of other such functionalisations for your learning experience.

You wont have to do heavy lifting like in the University but you will get everything you require
in the shortest learning span. The ideas are conveyed in a manner that allows you to do the practicum with complete confidence regardless of
your background.
In particular I have in mind and I am reviewing the Integrated Program in Business Analytics which is delivered in part by the Indian Institute of
Management Indore and of course Jigsaw. The course was administered for us by Moses Kola, Manager Long Term Programs, Jigsaw. He was ready to assist in all matters round the working  hours and round the year.
Especially he covered the gap between us the students and the Faculty from both institutes by conveying our difficulties and challenges to the faculty. He ensured that all the course material such as meeting links, code snippets, data sets etc reached us in time.

In particular he assisted students with working out timings and batches for the graded assessments and rescheduling of the assessments if necessary. He arranged open office sessions for all working batches so that we could interact with the course professors. And of course yes, he helped in the formation of a committee for the end course placements.
So yes, he was my go to person for anything and everything I needed. I hope if you are registering for this course you have the good luck of being assigned to Moses.
The Academic Coordinators from the IIM Indore side, Prof. Pritam Ranjan and from the Jigsaw side, Prof. Jitendra Manwani, deserve a noteworthy mention. Interacting with them, in class and open office, either directly or indirectly through other faculty,  was revealing in terms of academic as well as corporate trajectories and strategizing for a Business Analytics career. The gains are intangible if you consider the overall wisdom and expertise they (all faculty) bring to the table.

Also a word about the counselling team and career counsellors. They assist you in mapping the course delivery to your exact needs, resulting in  a precise and unique course structure for you. In returning to Jigsaw for future courses you will be assigned the same career counsellor for your future requirements or a different counsellor if you wish to start all over. Anyway the counsellors are well aware of, and trained to tailor the course to your complete profile and growth requirements, so do give importance to the admissions process and counselling track. I had the good opportunity of being assigned to Senior Counsellor Mohit Sareen, who helped me bridge the gap from plain graduate to student of IPBA. I hope you also get the best out of your counsellor if you are associating with Jigsaw.

Thank you Jigsaw, and people, all the best!

Rejoinder: For your coursework, assignments and project work I give five hints:
First Hint: It's simpler than you think!
Second Hint: It's not as simple as it looks!
Non-graded Hint: It is all before your eyes!
Graded Hint: It can get as tough as you can't think!
Notch Hint: As Mohit rightly says, Jigsaw is ten steps ahead of us!!

Enjoy!",5

Kalyan Venkatesh,"It was always a dream to get a certificate in Analytics. At the right time when I was searching for a good place to learn it, I came accross Jigsaw Academy & IIM-Indore offering a beautiful course in Business analytics.
After a small conversation with the sales team, I was convinced that this is a good place to get myself certified as a Business Analyst. Joined the course which was for 11 months and had a good experience from the beginning. The lecturers are pretty good with their subjects and give a good knowldge transfer. The support team especially Moses Kola was of a great help till the very end. It helped all of us in the batch to approach him for any kind of query we had and he solved it within a jif.
Hoping the certificate will get me on a higher note in my career.
Thanks Jigsaw Team.
Cheers.",4
ABHISHEK PRASAD NONIA,"Grt experience..I joined PGCP-DSML course. I have zero coding experience. I have never done coding before. But because of the experienced faculty of jigsaw, I get to learn new things everyday.
Jigsaw's experienced faculty helps the student a lot in learning coding.",5
Manojit Sarkar,"I come from an entirely different background, which is completely non-technical. I wanted to learn Data Science from an organization which is not only known for its courses on emerging technologies, but also provides great learning and Jigsaw Academy provided me just that!!

All the faculty members are very knowledgeable and very patient when it came to solving doubts and queries. Throughout the tenure of the course, Jigsaw Academy also conducted quite a few sessions with industry experts which was a great learning experience.

The program coordinator Moses has been very cooperative throughout the course. The best thing about him is he knows each student by their name, even if it means saving everyone's # it is a big thing!

The classes are also conducted only on Saturday's and Sunday's which is a boon for working professionals. The course content covered all the aspects of Data Science starting from teaching us about CRISP DM to inferential & descriptive statistics to machine learning & NLP. Also they covered all the important software used in Data Science like R, Python, SQL, Tableau, Hadoop, SPARK etc.

Joining the IPBA course provided by Jigsaw Academy in collaboration with IIM Indore, was one of the best decisions in my life. I would strongly recommend anyone willing to make a career in data science to consider joining this course.",5

mounika yelaverthi,"I had enrolled for IPBA course in collaboration with IIM-I which for 10 months period, this course gives an in-depth knowledge of analytics and covers almost all the aspects of the same. The faculty is very knowledgeable and they don't compromise on the quality of the content. Student concerns are resolved within no time. The support team is great, a special thanks to Mr. Moses Kola who takes up the concerns very seriously and is very supportive throughout the course period. There are frequent sessions of open office to discuss about the issues being faced. The course is very well designed, a person enrolled should have enthusiasm to practice more and more things. The faculty will teach and guide you to the right path but you have walk on it on your own, meaning they teach you all the necessary things but you are the only person who needs to practice and learn more and ask doubts. They teach from scratch from coding to analytics and stats. There are graded assignments for every topic and practice assignments too. There is access to IIM library as well. This course is completely worry every penny. I would recommend this course to anyone who's interested in pursuing analytics.",5
Neelkamal Deepak,"In order to explain my experience of this course i've breakdown my review into 5 major categories.
1) Quality and quantity
2) Student background and pace of course
3) Online and in-person class
4) Assignment and grading system
5) Student and mentor relation

So, first i'd like to emphasis on the part that due to COVID-19 situation I was not able to grab full extent of this program. And my batch suffered with the same circumstances.

without any delay lets pick the first point ""Quality and quantity"" of this course, according to me the quality of PGPDM module is pretty amazing and simplistic if you are new in data analytics and computers field.
You'll find no problem to understand the concept and you can easily apply all the concepts as well. Since I belong from CS background I found the quantity lil less for the money I paid.

2) Student background and pace of course

The dispersion of the course is extremely smooth, if you are a working buddy and still you want to make most of yourself at the weekend then you can manage your work and this module flawlessly.
If you belong from CS background then the starting of this course will be lil boring for you, but you will definitely enjoy the in-person class.

3) Online and in-person class

The most amazing part is in-person class, this is the day I was waiting whole week. I was able to clear most of the doubt in these classes and also we got to know each other's potential in these classes.
On the other hand online classes are short, mostly 2-4 hrs and if real time ques/ans is not possible, I mean not flawless like f2f interaction.

4) Assignment and grading system

Grading system is well mannered and I personally do not have any complain about that, although I have few suggestion to improve its efficiency. And the assignment are on weekly bases which was the best thing to keep us busy in the course. I hardly find any problem in this system.

5) Aspirant and mentor relation

Student and mentor relation is not extremely smooth. It is very good but not the best level. If you want grab some instant help then its not possible, plus you might have heard these lines by no. of mentors like "" I CAN EXPLAIN 100 TIMES, IF YOU WANT"", but truly no one wants to do that. Ya'know there are people from different background who find few concepts hard to understand. So yeah!!! sometimes you need to think like the way a student thinks, in order to explain.
But all things considered they help me every time.

NOTE: Due to COVID and some health related family issue I was not able to give my best but I did manage to make some good friends and mentors in this journey.",4
Devanshee Kothari,"As a commerce student & a keen learner who wants to grow & excel in Business Analytics, the IIM Indore's Integrated Program in Business Analytics, in partnership with Jigsaw Academy, has been an excellent knowledge-enriching learning experience for me.

The faculties here are experts in the subject area and are also humble with their teaching methods. The program coordinator Moses Kola has been very supportive throughout the 10-months program. Moses's help and guidance to each and every query of the students have made a smooth sailing experience for us during the program.

Today, businesses are striving to become ""data-driven,"" this course focuses on understanding key analytics concepts with dozens of real-world analytics problems and solutions across most major industries and business functions.

In the end, the IPBA program is a complete package for any student from any field who is curious about Business Analytics and wants to grow in the area in the future.",5
Chintan Patel,"The curriculum is very comprehensive and practical, also the faculty is very helpful and knowledgeable. Especially two professors Jitendra sir and Pritam sir, who not only taught the technical part but also helped us with using logical reasoning in data analytics and taught how to deal with adversities while managing a project.

This program is a true example of under promise and over delivery. Also our program coordinator Mr. Moses is very helpful and friendly person, he is always ready to help the students irrespective of time.

Overall my journey with IPBA (Integrated Program in Business Analytics) program was extremally exhilarating and thrilling and I look forward to be a part of the future programs of Jigsaw Academy for enhancing my skills.",5
Purva Chouhan,"Excellent course curriculum and case studies. End to end preparation to enter Analytics Industry.
They help with placements also. Thanks Jigsaw for all the support.",4
Vinayak s,"I attended this course over the period of Mid 2020 -Early 2021 .
It was an amazing learning experience overall.
Though there are a lot but I would say following are the few positives I would like to highlight about the course:
1: Gives a great introduction to the world of Statistics using R& Python and to the world of Machine Learning & Data Science.
2: Lots of hands on mini projects to hone your skills with.
3: Takes you from beginner level Data enthusiast to Medium level Data Science Analyst by the end of the term of the course.
4: Final Capstone project helps in using all the skills learnt throughout the course and gives a glimpse of how real time Industry projects will look like.
As always nothing is perfect , few issues I see with the course, which i will highlight as well:
1: Batch size is large needs to be reduced- as bigger batch size means less interaction with instructor.
2: The process of choosing the candidates for the course needs to be stricter - lot of non-serious candidates join for just the certificate and slow down the class progress cause they never prepare and come for the classes.

Last but not the least I would like to Thanks Mr Moses Kola who co-ordinates this program for Jigsaw academy- Moses is the most helpful person who takes care of students to the very best of his abilities, without his help I would not have completed this course.",5

The lecturers are highly knowledgeable and quiet experienced in Data Science & Machine Learning field. They shared a lot of real time experiences as a learning to us. Program Coordinators as well were very helpful and supportive all the time. However, like the institute name goes 'Jigsaw', the course module is also like a jigsaw puzzle, the program structure are in bits and pieces, you will be confused as “where am I” and “what I’m doing” they load you with lot of assignments, which were annoying during the course but you will realize that they were the best way to learn the subject. You really need a lot of perseverance and patience towards each and every chapters in the course and wait till the end to solve the puzzle. All and all Jigsaw is a good Institute to help you excel in Data Science and Machine Learning.",4

I would recommend this course to every HR professional who are eager to understand and work on Regression problems for forecasting data and for finding out parameters dependent on HR metrics using statistical models. Sound knowledge in mathematics and programming would be an added advantage to learn the concepts faster in class. The syllabus is robust and holistic, which has subjects on Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Data visualization using Tableau, Regression on Python, HR concepts, to name a few. During this course of 3-4 months, you would be rated based on the projects on real time HR data, 2 graded assignments and also your attendance. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and my project with my team mates.",5
Ketan Chaudhari,"Bad experience with online training. After some research and review, I joined data analyst course. Before joining course, consultant from jigsaw provided good information. But after joining the program, felt like I wasted money.
Course Structure is not as per industry.
Faculty teaching like they are just reading some manual.

Yes, I agree that there are some faculty who are good but sessions from such faculty was only small part and most of part covered by non experience person.

After trying to take refund, got to know that I wasted time and it's too late to ask for refund. There is so much to write but......

I will not recommend this institute for online training program.

Bhaargav Lakshmanan,"I completed IPBA offered by Jigsaw and IIM Indore.
The course was very well structured and delivered with great passion by Jigsaw and IIM-I faculties. Jigsaw LMS materials offered head start to the concepts, and with classes & projects allowing for hands-on coding on analytics and ML techniques, and detailed explanation on the topics. Data science subject is extremely vast with Statistics and algorithms having rich literature. I think the IPBA faculty team from Jigsaw & IIM-I did a great job in touching the core areas, setting in the necessary concepts and providing working demos/code for several key techniques & models, to allow one to further explore and navigate through this vast field. Throughout the course, the lectures were delivered by academicians with vast research and large-scale project experience in core subjects like statistics, rdbms systems, and big data tech. or by faculty with specific implementation experience in applying data, data science techniques and algorithms, visualizations. Attending such classes during weekends, and learning from offline videos/lecture notes through out, has probably been the best of use my weekends and spare time. Thanks to Jigsaw team esp. Mr. Moses Kola, (coordinates the program) who is always there to help and ease things out (not by moving test dates :P, but by offering positive perspective on things and his encouraging words) when the course got hectic during later half. Overall, this course is a great way to acquire analytics/ML/NLP/BI/Python/R/SQL/SQL/Spark/Tableau skills, very professionally run and offering great networking opportunities including access to IIM I faculties, industry experts in Jigsaw faculties, and peers with varied experience.",5

Mahesh Ambekar,"I have attended the IPBA (Integrated Program in Business Analytics) offered by Jigsaw-IIM Indore in collaboration, and it has been a great journey of learning and understanding the concepts and nuances of the Data Science and Business Analytics.

Course is a very good blend of the theory, statistics and a practical use/application of the same in the real world scenarioes. Learning Path and Curriculum designed for the course covers pretty much all the aspects of the Data Science and prepares you to work on the real-life problems at hand with much more confidence than you have had before joining the course.

Faculties and the staff is very helpful and patient in handling multiple requests and questions that students have from time to time. Project mentor (Kiran Kumar) assigned to us for the last leg of the course (Capstone Project) helped us in understanding how to approach a problem scenario with a step-by-step process and also kept us in the right direction of the project work.

Course coordinator Moses had been a great help in ensuring students have the right answers and support at the right time, be it any time of the day/night!

Overall a great learning and a right course to have for getting your hands-on knowledge on Data Science!

Thank you,
Mahesh.",5

They have made this program fantastic and simple with their way of teaching and with Moses as fantastic program coordinator i have always got a prompt response and support for the technical and non technical issues during program. The mechanism for resolving any issue by raising ticket helped resolving many issues. Issues such as conceptual clarity for any topic not understood, faculty member issue, Assignment issues,etc. all were being handled in smooth and hassle-free manner.

Also for the topics covered, at the end of every topic there will be assignment which will be either MCQ or Case Study based.
Towards the end of the program there will be a capstone project which either the students can bring on their own or Jigsaw will provide, where everyone will be working in groups which will basically cover the things covered in the whole course.
Also, on successful completion of the course you will be getting IIM Indore Alumni status which will be helpful for the placements.

Faculties: There will be faculties from both IIM Indore and Jigsaw Academy. The faculties are very good and are having good industrial experience.
Course coordinator Mr. Moses is quite helpful who is always available to sort any problems and anything we want to convey regarding the course, the faculties, arrange extra classes etc.

Overall this course is quite good for someone who wants to switch to or enter the Data Science field.",5
Leela SaiNadh Gade,"I have been student of latest batch in Cyber Security(Red Team), HackerU course from Jigsaw academy. I must say, this course have everything which helps a student build deeper knowledge in red teaming concepts. This course is not just meant for professional. It is framed in a way that a person who is new to IT field can learn things easily and master them in a very interesting way. Well structured, good material and practical knowledge will be gained. Faculty here dedicates all their time for teaching.",5
Rigved Hebalkar,"I chose this certification because of my passion for People Analytics and it has proved to be one of the best decision of my professional life.
It really feels good to be associated with Jigsaw Academy and IIM Indore for People Analytics and Digital HR Certification.

Even the support team and program manager are very agile in solving our certification related queries.",5
Arpit Dhawan,"I am currently pursuing IPBA (Integrated Programme in Business Analytics) Program from IIM-INDORE which is delivered through Jigsaw.

It is a great experience, however it has its ups and downs like every other course.

They have a great supportive staff and faculty and are very prompt in answering the queries esp. Moses who is available on Whatsapp and call.

The classes can be a bit difficult if you are not from a technical/analytical background.

Overall great learning experience and I hope they can reach further levels by considering the feedbacks from the students.",4
Pooja Jagadish,"After doing much research on the best analytics coaching institute in Bangalore, I joined jigsaw academy boot camp classroom program.
The sessions were very informative and eat too understand. Doubts were cleared and the concepts were made easier to understand. I would recommend this institute for any working professional or a fresher.
Real time examples were given in explaining each concept. Timely quizzes were conducted and the videos were extremely helpful. They even offer 100% placement assistance with mock interviews and Viva.
The support from the team was good. As a working professional and a student of jigsaw, I am happy with the data science boot camp classroom program which I opted. It's worth!",4
Nithin J,"Three aspects and my review for them

1) Course content - The pre class videos were more than sufficient for you to get greater understanding over the subject.
The Live class was more of a revision/learning and clearing the concepts learnt in the pre class video.
A suggestion to the team here would be - > If you can add some post class videos (self paced) , it can give us more insights about the subject.

2)Jigsaw support - I would give a 5 on 5 for this facility because the very thing that anyone would want when they are stuck somewhere is assistance and all my support tickets were addressed with 24hrs and most of them within 10 hrs of time.

3)Placement assistance - This facility only begins after we submit all our assignments and get our final certification. this ensures that we are partially eligible to start attending interviews. Resume reviews, mock interviews with the faculties and assistance before interviews is something that needs to be appreciated.

I personally liked my duration at the course.",4
ankitha sm,"My experience was great in jigsaw academy, I have enrolled for full stack data science, initially i no nothing about data science course and tools they use for...

Basically they start with Excel tools, tableau, R programming, statistical models, python and finally machine learning.

The professors/lecturers were all well versed with their subject and they were readily available & helpful.  Even though the program was really hectic,
demanding, sometimes nerve breaking, but the entire journey has been a wondrous one. The Academy provided us with extra classes as and when the position needed.
One need to serve plenty of assignments which will certainly give sleepless nights in days and weeks, but there is a sense of achievement after going through this struggle. For me, Jigsaw Academy is certainly synonym of the word ""trust"". Especially,
I want to mention two names, Mr. Dipyaman Sir, for aiding us with our Capstone Project, and Mr. Irshad our coordinator, many times helping us out of the path.",5

Arun Krishnan,"Jigsaw Academy's 3-months intensive Bootcamp course is the best option for someone  who wants to pursue a career in data analytics.
It's a good program with all well experienced teaching faculty ( mostly people who are also working in very good positions at best firms).
The classrooms and facilities are good.
The Non-teaching staff (Mr.Giri) has been a great support during & after the program for any concern if one had to address.

MY Suggestion for people who are reading and planning to join this course would be.
Please have a basic understanding about data analytics and also be good with statistics and logical reasoning. It will help you a lot in the learning process. Invest and join the course only AND only if you can give you're 100%.",5

The support staff ( Especially  Giriprasad M ) are experts so know the ins and outs of the course and are willing to help with students needs.

The Faculty depends on the course u to take and Data science faculty were good at put concepts across and helping us understand and learn core concepts.",4
sunny surve,"First for most, I must acknowledge without hesitation that learning was superb, great and wonderful. Personally speaking, It was a very long time back literally when I had studied during academic.
There was anxiety before commencement of the program that I be able to continue studying parallely having a profession?
But course designing and all weekend schedules have been utmost flexible, where I could not find a single glitch. My many thanks to all faculties for having vast knowledge and being given opportunity to learn from their individual experiences.

Mr Moses, I must say that he is a life line support and most approachable.
He has been responsive no matter how busy he is, rarely could have an instance call go unanswered.
He has been instrumental in providing clarification and furnishing materials. I recall his kind help especially when I was down with COVID19 during 2nd wave.
Approaching him justifies indeed he is IPBA support line. All conversations related to IPBA, ever felt reaching out to a friend for help and was served immediately.
My big thanks to him.",5
keivaly Pujara,"Hi,
I’ve recently finished full stack data science program by Jigsaw Academy. I have studied Automobile engineering + Management, with no experience of coding whatsoever, currently working with JSW steel in channel sales. I had a couple of subjects on business analytics and BI during MBA wherein I had gotten a flavour of what analytics is and when I was looking to upskill in this particular area I came across Jigsaw academy’s NASSCOM certified online program. It was instructor led, every weekend 3hrs session each.
I would highly recommend the program for anyone who wants to start from scratch, here’s a list of few things that I really liked about the program:
1. Breaking down of concepts: The faculty was really amazing and he broke down every machine learning concept and explained it step by step so simply and with such depth that one would develop a natural intuition for understanding of those algorithms. We would understand everything from the point of view of Mathematics, graphical understanding, intuition, coding and finally the business application.
2. Even though I didn’t have any prior experience of coding, it was taught from basic and for every algorithm we would do real time practice for coding the same. By the end of the curriculum, I was able to code in both R and Python efficiently.
3.  One of the biggest advantage for instructor led class v/s MOOC is the doubt clearing sessions, for any assignments that you have, can always raise a ticket and doubt was resolved within hours!
Probably the only suggestion from my side to further improve the program would be inclusion of couple of more algorithms such as SVM, Monte Carlo, light boost, xgboost etc. And also Tableau was self paced, perhaps they can include a live lecture on that as well…and those students who done FSDS, they can perhaps provide a cheaper Deep Learning add on course.",5
hemang dagha,I have recently competed my FSDS certification with Jigsaw Academy. And my journey with the institute was very fruitful and knowledge. I have worked on real time projects : Machine learning algorithm using python and did detailed statistical analysis using python(jypther notebook) . I got an opportunity to explored Tableau (Data Visualization tool). Other than that I got prompt responses and assistances on my queries.,5
Hiral Dave (Hiral Vyas Dave),"After going through web reviews, I enrolled for Full Stack Data Science program at Jigsaw Academy. Videos, transcripts and assignments are quiet useful for a good start in the field of Data Science. What specially I liked about the course is Capstone project and Viva process which makes person  understand the concepts thoroughly. Support faculty is very helpful.",4
Rabi Jaiswal,"I have completed Full stack data science program from jigsaw academy. Before joining i did a lot of research about which institute to join for data science program and i found that jigsaw academy was  the top institute for analytics and yes it proved to be right. Data science is a field where knowing concepts is very important and jigsaw faculties have explained concepts of each topics from scratch.  After the end of my course i am confident about concepts and tools required for a data science project  . For coding they have taught us how to code in tools R,Python and Sas.  My experience has been wonderful and i would recommend people who aspire to come in the field of data science should join Jigsaw academy.",5
Afzal Veettil,"Learning Data Science at Jigsaw has been an awesome experience. I joined the course with a lot of apprehension about the content, but the pre-class videos eased my learning experience and follow the actual class easily. Like any online courses, you have to be self-motivated, but the faculty has been very supportive as well as very knowledgeable in their areas. Jigsaw has a good team, faculties as well as the support staff. I recommend Jigsaw as a great place to start your journey in to the world of data science.",4
Jasper Sheldon,"I did Full stack data science program with Jigsaw academy. To begin with, First their content is very good for beginner to start with.Their teachings and explanations are too good. Second is the value for money ,They did justice to the money i spent i'm totally satisfied with the content.
Next to talk about is their mentors , I did online classes with them so its very fast paced so most of the time i needed help they supported me through out the course. Help and support team attended every query of mine immediately. Their placement team was also very helpful.

I learnt Tableau,R,python and statistics from the course I highly recommend this course if your planning to switch over to data science.They provide everything for you to begin with. Real time projects and mostly those assignments will make sure you learn everything.Apart from this their external sources they provide will lend you hand at times when you struggle.So thanks Jigsaw .

One humble request , i would suggest a update to the topic related to machine learning in python. It had a good content i'm not denying that but a deeper reach out and explaining about all the other algorithms ,regularization, cross validation would be good for beginners to lean.

Thank you for the amazing learning experience!!!",4
dravid deedfoot,"Completed Big data specialization course from Jigsaw. Course is well structured and easy to understand. Hands on experience via Lab and case studies make it lot more interesting to learn and grasp the content. Faculty support is good. Apart from the course, Jigsaw hosts lot of competitions where students can connect with industry experts and learn by working on projects in the competition. Really appreciate Jigsaw academy's efforts to conduct such events and engage students. Jigsaw is like a family. They have helped me build my profile in all possible ways and were always there when i needed them. I would recommend students and working professionals who want to get into big data analytics to join the Jigsaw community.",5
Rajat D,"Hello All,
Let me share my inputs and comments about my stint at Jigsaw Academy as a student and it is going to be a slightly lengthy post as would like to cover esentially some finer details.
I was a part of the Comprehensive Bootcamp program in 2018 and probably one of my pivotal decisions towards shaping my career.
After 18 years of work and not sure of the next BIG leap to take, you tend to ask questions about ""What Next"", "" Why this"" or ""Why that"", etc....I was going through the same situation and that's when after completing Online certification in R in 2017 and doing some work on Analytics within my domain, I realised that Online education can only help me get this far but what I needed were 2 things :
1) A classroom setting and
2) Emphasis on learning how to apply Data Science to solve real world problems.

With that thought, I started speaking with various institutes, and finally zeroed in on Jigsaw...
At that time, I found some interesting things about them.
1) They were Education/Knowledge partners with IIMB at one point in time and
2) My company endorsed them and we had our Sr. leadership also give Talks periodically.

After joining the instititute, what I liked best about  them was their teaching methodology. There emphasis was never on learning how to cod, or to just learn Python or R etc, but was on developing your fundamental way of thinking or what I would call the ""Basics of Data Science""..We had multiple classes on Hypothesis testing, understanding not only what Regression is but the applicability of those techniques in the real world..

Mayukh Ghosh was awesome. He taught exactly the way I wanted a teacher to. Not to focus on coding only but on the applicability on it...
He always had an answer with examples on Regression, Classification and my favourite of all ""Time series""..

Mayukh has a gift. he could decide to be an acamedician in one class or could alienate completely in another one if he felt the group is ready to get into a working session...
A thorough gentleman who knows his craft well.

Kunaal Naik was also a lot of fun. His session on ML with Python was to be honest quite taxing because of the time issue but was very informative..His sessions were more hands on and I wished we could spend more time learning more on Random forest and Decision trees etc.

But the 1st class was probably the best not only because it was an Ice breaker or rather going back to the calssroom after 18 years but the session was very nice. Mahesh was the Instructor and covered Advanced Excel and  I learnt a lot inspite of using Excel for so many years.

Overall, post completion and the Capstone Project, I was able to get into the Advanced Analytics team within my company and today lead a team of Data scientists and BI experts building and enhancing Cognitive Analytical solutions to help solve process issues for my clients and also to making processes Smarter.

I would like to conclude that Learning is a journey and is neverending but my stint with Jigsaw truly enabled me to take the Plunge and make a Mid career switch into Analytics..

All the Best.",5
Dikshant Deshmukh,Had an amazing experience at Jigsaw Academy! I pursued Data Science Bootcamp course. They have the best course structure. The faculty is really thorough in teaching and focus on each student doubts and clarifications. Really helped build confidence in industry and with concepts for technology I only imagined I will understand. Looking at demand of data analyst in industry courses offered by Jigsaw are very helpful. Jigsaw has good placement cell as well as i got job while pursuing the course. Jigsaw plcement cell really help students in placement guidence. Giriprasad is really helpful person who help everyone during the course period. I really enjoyed the course at Jigsaw:),5

Snigdha Shukla,"Course content of good..but as far as placement is concerned ,they do nothing. I completed two courses from Jigsaw ,data science for beginners and data science with R. But after completing course few months after I contacted for placement. Many times they asked me to update my CV and send back. After sometime mock interview was contacted but it was just a joke..after asking some stats formulas I was asked I need to learn more although I m doing freelancing on same and did many projects. After that I didn't get any response from there.",2
Renil Austin Mendez,"I have enrolled the data science course provided by Jigsaw and their modules and services made a comfortable platform for a swift transition from a non IT Background to Analytics.  Jigsaw's real time case studies and assignments gave me a lot of knowledge on various business domains and how they apply data science in an application point of view. I sure got all the things that has been expected from the academy and looking forward to learning more from Jigsaw.
I got an internship opportunity through Jigsaw's placement support which provides a decent stipend of 25k. It was possible because of their constant cooperation and guidance thoughtout my job hunt.",5
Tejas Sridhar,"I was a student in the IPBA batch ending in July 2021. I must say the faculty is exceptionally well informed and extremely patient with any and all queries you could possibly have. The program is managed by Moses who makes the whole interface of information back and forth seamless and will ensure you get the maximum benefit and most efficient turnaround times on any and all queries you put in. If you get a chance to interact with Professor Jitendra, Professor Saurabh or Professor Ranjan, you will realise it is entirely worth the time and effort and the way they will push you towards better learning is euphoric. All in all, this is an executive program, meaning you obviously must not expect everything to be spoonfed, but with the right drive and if you are willing to give this program time and effort, this just may be the best investment you could make on setting a concrete career trajectory for yourself among some of the best minds in the industry and academia.",5
Brajesh Khare,"People Analytics and Digital HR program is timed very aptly when we, HR professionals are at the inflexion point of leveraging technology like never before to manage people remotely due to COVID19.

Saugat Nayak,"“Jigsaw Institute is the way to go if you want to learn and excel in the field of analytics.”
Flexible, affordable and extremely competent faculties. Jigsaw Online Institute provides one of the best courses.
Course materials and mentoring approach are good.  Sarita and Gaurav did a great job of communicating and making it a more intimate arrangement. A lot of online courses fail because of the isolation. They prepare people to carry out skills in the real world. Students gets boundless support from the support team, especially from Moses, who is always happy to help you.
Keep up the good work!",5

preeti gupta,"IPBA Program is one complete package to become a Data Scientist. As suggested the market is loaded with Data science related learning platforms and institutes. Choosing one program to become knowledgeable certified candidate is challenging task. IPBA Program from IIM Indore is one amazing program covering all the core topics from scratch. I come from finance background, was not even aware about coding python, but always wanted to get into IT and future promising career. I still remember Prof Jitendra's first python class, the way he started teaching coding focusing on non-tech persons like me was amazing. IPBA program is well structured covering all the major topics.

Thanks for Prof Harshal, Jitendra and Pritram for making all the concepts clear and giving me the apt for data science. Statistics has been always my favourite topic but the way it is applied in real business world was fantastically taught by Prof Harshal. Special thanks to our Program coordinator Moses who made everything accessible and was always there to help to solve our queries and being a great support between the department and students.

Long story short, it was an amazing experience and journey for me, I always wanted to get in this buzz world field so called “Data science” and happy that I took up IPBA program. In such a short duration of 10-month program I consider myself well-equipped to change my career and take up a new role in this field.",5

I'd like to endorse this course and academy for people who're looking, reading or passionate to jump unto the field of Analytics and Big data. Their support is astounding, videos are precise and content is adequate. There's no other academy in India I've heard of or know of, which matches the likes of Jigsaw Academy. I'll keep coming back to learn more. These guys are great.",4

Special Mention to Gunnvant Singh Saini for his teaching (especially Deep Learning) and Sarita Digumurthi for her excellent teaching in probability and statistics.
This course helped me to learn the concepts in depth and strengthen my basics. I will definitely recommend Jigsaw for a fresher/experienced person thinking to shift career towards data science. Thanks for Jigsaw management as well for handling my special requests.",5
Sourav Biswas,"It is a very compact course and good to learn analytics from the scratch.For me yes it is worth investing time and money. I was totally new to analytics and it really helped me a lot to change or restart my career. In 69000/- I got the Big Data Unicorn which includes- SAS,R,PYTHON,EXCEL,BIG DATA ANALYTICS,APACHE SPARK, APACHE STORM,CASSANDRA,MONGODB which I think quite affordable. The case studies and assignments are really helpful to gain knowledge.I finished the data science course in 8 months. And just after finishing it,I got an Internship opportunity from Jigsaw in a Marketing Analytics Company in Bangalore with some kind of job assurance as per my performance in the internship period. Some feedback I would like to share that- the python course can be bit more informative. There should be a capstone project in python. Implementation of decision tree in SAS would be a good option and also some algorithms like KNN,random forest,bagging,boosting,stacking,K fold cross validation can be included in R. Faculties are good. Promptness in response to the tickets from the faculties, is average. Placement support is very good. I managed to get 3 jobs till date out of 20 interviews they provided. I am discarding 1 star because I think quality of python faculty can be better. Otherwise jigsaw is very good and highly recommended.",4
navyasree kollipara,"Jigsaw actually helped me a lot in getting good knowledge on the subject(Theoretical, coding, presenting) … I was a person who was “Zero” in coding before i got in there, now that i have completed the course i feel good about my coding abilities the reason for that is they teach us from that zeroth point . We have access for video content along with the in person classes where we always had a reference to what we learnt in class. After completing the project with their assistance I have gained more practical knowledge. Over all a very good experience.

I would like to thank Jigsaw for all the support they gave me. Happy to be a alumni of Jigsaw.",5
Gurpreet Singh,"My journey with Jigsaw have been thoroughly engaging, fascinating and satisfying. I have taken almost all courses offered by Jigsaw. All the course contents have been well researched and of high quality. I found the case studies to be especially thought provoking leading to hands-on learning. The courses are right on target in teaching us how to think like a statistician in handling various types of data.

The courses aptly cover the best industry practices to tackle various analytical problems. The assignments, quizzes and tests all aid in the learning. I feel I have attained comprehensive knowledge and experience to give me a jump start in my career as a future data scientist.",5
Anupama Shenoy,"My brother suggested me to join Jigsaw Academy as I wanted to shift my career from IT to Analytics and It was an excellent decision of joining Jigsaw Academy. Being an Engineering graduate with Computer Science as background was of course a little bit hard to understand the statistical concepts and make Business sense out of it. But Jigsaw Academy have just simplified it. I have enrolled for their Foundation course in Analytics, which is the base course for Analytics. The case studies which they cover during the class is very realistic which will help you to understand the raw data much better. The entire Foundation course is designed in such a way that it would help any fresher to build up strong basics in analytics. One of the key advantage of joining Jigsaw Academy is that you will have access to the remote server where you can practice on the case studies. The Faculties are exceptionally good with experienced people around and on other hand the support team is one of the best customer service team I have seen so far. They answer your queries within short period of time. Jigsaw Academy also assists students in getting placed in companies after the completion of the course. Hoping to get placed soon after the completion of the course. I would definitely recommend this course to anybody who is planning to switch their career to analytics. My Best wishes to the Jigsaw Team! Happy Learning!

Thanks

Ajoy Ashok Kumar,"With my growing interest towards Analytics and being a complete beginner to this field, I needed to get a strong understanding of the concepts involved. So, I decided to take the Foundation Course from Jigsaw Academy.

I must say that I really enjoyed learning. The course was comprehensive and rigorous with lots of challenging Case Studies that forced me to learn and explore a wide range of concepts.

The Faculty were extremely knowledgeable with lots of experience and have helped me a lot by clearing my doubts.

The Support team was just outstanding. Very friendly, very helpful and very quick in responding to my queries and solving any issue I had immediately.

The experience I had was wonderful, satisfying and intellectually fulfilling. Now being confident of my skills, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in venturing into the field of Analytics  as this will help you build a strong foundation indeed.

Thank you Jigsaw!",5
aakanksha sharma,"I joined Jigsaw last October in the Analytics Online Course. As a finance student I must say course material is understandable so far, not technical even for coding language like SAS and Advance Excel. Plus assignments and project were pretty helpful to understand the statistical concepts. I find the faculty and student support very helpful and supportive. Special mention for Mayukh sir, who guided me to understand SAS better. I haven't got any opportunity to work in this profile but for studies prospective this course is bliss for me.",4
chetan arora,"Had a great experience with Jigsaw, would do couple of more courses in future as well. I appreciate the support team for being there all the time, esp Moses. He sorted out the access related issues even at 11 PM at night.

Jigsaw's case studies, assignments, class experience is fantastic. One can actually assess Jigsaw's analytic elixir only after experiencing it.  Classes taken by Sarita are the best ones compared to all other institutes. I can say that because i had experienced other institutes as well.

Joining the foundation course earlier in the carrier will be more beneficial. Current MBA/Btech students must join if they want to make their carrier in this field. Would also suggest jobseekers for not being fully dependent for the placement activities, though they provide good placement assistance.",5
Animesh Devarshi,"Indeed a great learning experience. The course at Jigsaw academy is well structured and application based. The standard of assignments and case studies are high which will help in getting strong hold of fundamental concepts.

The webinars arranged by Jigsaw are awesome. The speakers were masters of their fields. I learned a lot.",5

Sachin Attri,Jigsaw Academy is the first platform where I started with online learning. I procrastinated and came back to the courses after completing over 40 Udemy courses and some really costly ML and AI courses. I came back after a simple understanding. Most of renowned centers are more about side garnishing but Jigsaw provides the Paneer I want. They provide a clear path where others struggle to provide a direction. Jigsaw is my Nex-gen IT tech learning platform. I'm just so humbled by their staff.,5
divya k,"As I was looking for a transition to a career in analytics, I started out with my research on where to start on Google and I came across Jigsaw Academy. I found it as an ideal start to bridge the skill gap since I belong to a non engineering/programming background. Through reviews from people who enrolled with Jigsaw in the past for different courses, I could make a well informed decision that the courses offer what they promise. I’ve enrolled to the course Data Science with SAS. Although with zero knowledge of coding, the learning process had been very convenient since the program has been designed in such a way that it starts from the scratch and progresses gradually. The pre class videos are very informative and they build a concrete base for the class recordings. The discussion forums are extremely helpful for information sharing with fellow students and forum managers regarding anything and everything about the course, classes and assignments. It’s totally worth the amount and time invested in it and I would definitely recommend Jigsaw Academy for people who are keen on building a career in the field of analytics.",5

Akhil Jain,"Being a MBA, I was into management job and was doing pretty well, but after a year, data science got my attention and I desperately wanted to get into the field. So, I started looking for a course and an institute which can help me in learning the concepts of Analytics as well as getting a job in Analytics industry. After doing lot of research on google, I decided to enroll for Data Science with SAS online course with Jigsaw Academy. All the lectures have been designed so well that even a novice can understand them well with little seriousness and dedication. I am really grateful to the institute to help me immensely in making my career in the field of my choice. I would like to make special mention of placement team. After completing course in Jigsaw, Roopa and team constantly shared my resume with good companies. I got a job offer with a quality start-up through Jigsaw placement team. After working there for a year, I asked team if they can help me again to get another job. Team is so wonderful and active that I got another offer with a very well-known US based bank for a very good job profile through them. Their placement team is so strong and has so many contacts in industry that you will end up with a good offer in your hand, if you show some serious devotion towards learning. Placement team leaves no stone unturned to get students good jobs. If you honestly put efforts in learning and are serious to make career into data science then I don't see any reason that you being a jigsaw student will not get a job in data science field with a good company and make it big in your career.",5

The case studies  and all the supplementary material provided is more practical and less theoretical and gives you a good feel of a real world scenario. It feels like you are having a on job training while attending the course. The video content is a perfect way to highlight important details and reinforce concepts and ideas.

All the value added services as part of registering for the courses / specialization and not to forget the customer services which was very prompt and helpful at all times made the entire experience even better. I greatly appreciate the commitment shown by the entire group of Jigsaw which is visible in the manner they work very hard and are always available to all the concerns raised by their students.

Priya P,"My recent experience with Jigsaw has me completely disappointed. I wanted to enroll for the full stack Java developer course. While enrolling the sales guy/student advisor-Dipanjan- was constantly following up with me about making the initial payment. So i made the payment. However, they decided to cancel the batch with no explanations and said money will be refunded in 14 days. All well and good.

However, its been more than 3 weeks and I still don't have my money back. The student advisor when contacted, directed me to another team. I wrote to this student advisor's manager- Parvathi as well and she does not even have the courtesy to respond that they are working on it.

I am now running around with emails going back and forth trying to get my money back. Their support team closed the ticket without resolving my issue saying- yet another team will contact me about the refund.

This is unacceptable. I did not expect this kind of service from Jigsaw. They don't even let you sit in one demo class before committing to the course. I cannot believe Jigsaw's standards have become so low and all they want is people's money with no responsibility on following through with their promises.

I would advise everyone to be wary of of Jigsaw and enrol at your own risk- without demo classes and there is no way of getting out once they have your money.",1

Secondly, I really appreciate the Jigsaw technical team (Mr. Moses) for resolving any issues related to uploading videos / assignments / server access etc.
Whenever I had any issue for last 3 years, my queries were listened carefully and always resolved timely, no follow-ups required.

arusarka ghosh,"If you really want to pursue your career in Analytics there is no other place better than Jigsaw Academy. They will give you armor and sword and now analytics-battle-field is yours. Just after completing the Full Stack Data Science Course I got my breakthrough in Pharmaceutical Market Research with Harman India. While doing the course I got exposure to R, Python, SQL and Tableau and have done lots of pilot projects using OLS, Logistics, Random Forest, Clustering and Time Series algorithms. Initially these hands on experiences have helped me a lot to adopt real business scenarios. I'm really thankful to Jigsaw faculty. I also want to mention Giriprasad's name and his Student Support team who are giving their more than 100% effort to keep the work flow in the back end. Jigsaw is truly no. 1. A person like Sarita leading this Institute from the front is helping Jigsaw to maintain the no. 1 position.",5

Abhishek Sharma,"IIM Indore & Jigsaw IPBA - Integrated program in business analytics - is GREAT.
Classes are hassle-free for all of those applicants that are already working, and therefore busy during week-days, and the related JLC portal that you have granted access to has plenty of videos and material in general for you to prepare.

Professors are all well qualified and eager to help during and after classes if you need any support. Kuddos to Jitendra and Prof Pritam.

Faculty is very supportive and always eager to listen to students if any disconcertment might arise over course structure, additional classes to be provided, and so on. Kuddos to *Moses Kola*.  If there are any questions to ask and direct answers to gather he is always there for you.

I am fully satisfied with being part of this journey, it is a serious and High-Level Education Program provided by IIM Indore and Jigsaw Academy.
Thanks to IIM Indore, Jigsaw, in Particular:- Prof Pritam, Prof Jitendra and Moses Kola for this wonderful journey. God bless you all!!:)",5
Hari Alankala,"Jigsaw Academy helped me gain the knowledge in Statistical analysis using Excel and SAS, which can be applied in various business scenarios. The most important thing for student is to be commitment in their course to successfully complete the course because it requires a lot of self-study and work on assignments provided by Jigsaw.  I recommend Jigsaw Academy for the students who wants to make a carrier in Analytics.",5
Varun Bhat,"For someone who is looking to get into data science this course would be a good starting point.
The faculty at Jigsaw is also very good -
Statistical concepts which are slightly hard to understand especially for people coming from non-stats background (including me-Mechanical engineer) were made easier by faculties such as Manoj,Mayukh and Sarita.
R and Python covered by Gunnvant and Kunaal was also very good.
Giriprasad and the support team provided timely responses to any issues raised by the students.
My advice: Data science cannot be mastered within a period of 3–6 months. But if the student is willing to put in the required effort, Jigsaw provides the necessary support and guidance to make a transition into the world of data.",4
Sandeep Gupta,"My experience has been very good at Jigsaw. I enrolled myself in self learner courses in Analytics, R and Big data, online course material is designed and organized very well. Their support team is prompt in responding to queries/issues. Overall very nice learning experience.",4

Lopamudra Pattnaik,Data science is a emerging sector in India. It is difficult for a non-statistical background  student like me (B-tech) to understand the concept and do the assignment of Jigsaw. I am happy that I got an internship within my course duration. Still I have not yet completed my certification. Jobs for fresher is difficult. Before choosing any course just have a talk with the faculty because they only can guide you the best according to your profile.,5
Balaji Athreya,"As a mid level manager in IT field, I was at cross roads regarding my future career decisions.  I wanted to venture in to Analytics field so that my domain experience would get enhanced with analytics hands on exposure.

From my  experience with Jigsaw academy, I would any day recommend it to analytics aspirants. This is the best place to start with for Analytics foundation. The courses blend right amount of theory combined with Business cases. Also this is economical compared to other high end programs in analytics field which concentrates more on theoretical aspects.

I enjoyed learning in Jigsaw academy.

Shishir Pandey,"Hi All,

A collection of all sorts of analytic's courses which Jigsaw provides along with the faculties who are having very good real time experience makes Jigsaw exception platform .It has helped me understanding the real meaning of Analytics and has also me to realize the importance of it across industries. The portable nature of  classes along with a very interactive learning of the tools like SAS etc  which are the market leaders  has really turned me on to join the course. Unlike other institution they had also given me a chance to undergo the first classes free of cost and it helped me to gain confidence whether join the classes or not and to realize my comfort zone with the on line classes. In addition to the very well information that they would provide during the classes , Jigsaw would also share good materials and their real time implementation of analytics across the corporate. One more better part of Jigsaw is that for the classes that we have missed they would again give us the opportunity to cover up by providing the same or better faculty . One of the best and foremost features of Jigsaw and its employees are they are very responsive in nature and treat their students very friendly. Overall i would  advise a student who is about to start his carrier in Analytics Jigsaw would be best platform. Thanks a lot to Gaurav sir & Sarita mam for initiating  such blend of online data  analytics course which has helped the students to excel their carrier into analytics. My special thanks to  Moses who was very supportive and a quick resolver for any technical challenges which we have come across throughout the courses.

vicky crasto,"Referring to the post by Anit Antonito, I would like to highlight some points about my experience with Jigsaw Academy.

I have taken all the 3 courses SAS, R, and Python. I believe that all 3 have their own place in the analytics arena today. Companies in different domains have different requirements and it helps to be well prepared if one is looking out for analytics jobs as a fresher or looking to change streams in mid-career.

First and foremost, let us face the fact, no one can assure you a job, they can only help you prepare for it. Each one needs to invest their time and effort to complete all the courses

I have been a student at Jigsaw Academy for the last one year and very satisfied with my investment in the program.

Jigsaw Academy conducts a lot of activities over and above the course delivery to add to your analytics acumen. Apart from the easy to understand course materials and good faculty support, they conduct monthly contests which give you a taste of the real-world challenges. Relevant post and updates about the developments in data science on Forums and Blogs.
Regular sessions with industry mentors to help you sharpen your skills. I have attended a couple of these webinars and they are excellent! Weekly jobs post from within their corporate network and from others job portals.

Currently, I am in the process of finding a job, being from a different domain it is difficult but not impossible. Jigsaw mentors advised me to solve as many case studies as possible and maintain a GitHub profile which is helping me to get shortlisted.  Also, the placement team at jigsaw has been forwarding my resume to their connections.

Thanks to Jigsaw for helping a non-programming background, MBA Finance graduate to transform into a new age data analytics professional.",5
Vijaykumar Ahamadabade,"Great Course. I love the way it is designed and delivered. I learned a lot.

Rajshekhar K,"I have more than 20 years experience in IT Infrastructure, not much exposure to coding.

But right from the payment of fees to the doubt clarification every thing has run seamlessly enough for me to be delighted of this course. The content for each module is excellent. The MCQ which one has to take after each module is great and tests the logic and understanding of the concepts extensively. The assignments for each topic is based on the industrial problem and gives a hand on industry exposure.
All in all I have had a wonderful experience and hopefully Jigsaw Academy will continue with the good work.",4

It would not be possible without a help from a mentor and talking about it the only name strikes my mind, Mr. Mayukh Ghosh, faculty of Jigsaw. His weekend classes is all about exploring and gaining knowledge. Apart from that whenever I approached him with any query, he have guided me.

Thanks Jigsaw for having such excellent people in your faculty and such an excellent compact program for getting started with Data Science",5

Sukalp Shivam,"I enrolled with Data scientist course in Feb 2017.The materials which jigsaw is providing is really nice and effective.I got an opportunity to do internship in start up company within course duration.so I am thankful to the academy for this opportunity.
But my suggestion is for the B.tech students that if they are interested to do this course then first needs to clear the concept with statistics and  Business terminology.If you are fresher then its difficult to get job in present market.
I would highly recommend taking up internships as its a rich learning ground and helps to hone your analytical skills before you land your dream job",4
Rajesh Sundaram,"I would like to highlight key positive points about Jigsaw Academy

Great structured Video training sessions & data set for assignments and Capstone project

Ananth krishna,"I have enrolled for Combo courses (Data Science with SAS,Financial analytics and Data Science with R).

The course content is perfectly designed , well structured and organised on the LMS , and beautifully delivered by the faculty.

The best institute that is currently available to learn the Analytics. I recommend Jigsaw to everyone who wish to take the Analytics course.

The courses are best suited for MBA students and for professionals who wish to start their career in Analytics field.",5
Preetha Rajan,"Econometrics and Statistical Analysis have always been my passion since high school. It has been a dream of mine to pursue a career in the field of Business Analytics, characterized by the extensive application of Econometrics, Statistical concepts and Predictive Modeling techniques, every day, on the job. It is thanks to Jigsaw Academy that this dream is finally going to come true!

Even though I have a Master's degree in Economics from the University of Auckland, I found that I unfortunately, did not have the required skills to enter the Analytics Industry, as a Fresher. After an extensive search for suitable Analytical training institutes, I came across Jigsaw Academy and I honestly, thank my lucky stars that I did! Not only was the course content very exciting but the fees were very reasonable! Believe me, I came across so many fly-by-night institutes, who were only interested in money and not the welfare of the student!

Learning Analytics with Jigsaw Academy has been nothing short of an exciting journey! It was a fun process, where I could learn with confidence, knowing that my lectures were being handled by experts from the industry, with years of experience behind them! I would like to especially mention Saritha here. One of the best teachers, I've ever had, in my life! I always looked forward to her lectures on what were seemingly complicated (but incredibly exciting!) SAS topics such as SAS Functions and Procedures, SAS Combining and Merging, etc. Also, it was fantastic to work with data sets from real life case studies (I am especially fond of the Horse Racing Case Study!) where you get the opportunity to think on your feet and begin acting like a real Analyst! Handling such data sets also gives me immense confidence to handle complicated interviews! With Jigsaw, you can expect nothing but the best!

Also, as a student, technical support is incredibly important, especially if the entire learning process takes place online, with assignments to be submitted on the Remote Desktop. All I can say is, throughout my time at Jigsaw, I have had absolutely nothing to worry about! The technical team at Jigsaw have been extremely supportive in understanding my needs and anxieties as a student and are just a phone call or an email away! :) Many thanks Mr. Moses, Mr. Ramesh and the rest of your awesome team for making my learning experience a stress free one! :)

Jigsaw Academy also has a great placement assistance team, which takes the time and trouble to review your CV and makes very useful suggestions for improvement and also takes trouble to share a question bank consisting of important questions which could be asked at an interview!

Face it, Jigsaw Academy is one of those institutes, which not only imparts valuable knowledge to students, but is also involved in the all round preparation for crucial next steps, such as job interviews, etc. A special thanks to Ms. Roopashri, for all her help and advice! :)

My advice to anyone who wishes to pursue a career in Analytics, but requires certain critical skills to make that dream come true, is to look no further. Let Jigsaw Academy be the institute to help you out in pursuit of your dreams! :)",5
monica bhandari,What can I say; I found Jigsaw Academy as one of the best in fields of online courses. The overall curriculum is well designed for even those students who have no knowledge of analytic. The best part I loved in this course is online classes and material along with recordings which helped me to study any time as I can't avail proper class due to my odd working hours. And last but not the least I really want to thank Moses for all the help and support provided by him for timely completion of the course,4
Tarun Kumawat,"I just completed my Full stack in data science course from Jigsaw, the Journey of course is excellent. Jigsaw Faculty support and Customer support is very prompt. they helped a lot during the course. course content is crisp and clear.

ankit mongia,"Hi All,
I am writing this review after the completion of 2 courses that I did From Jigsaw Academy. “Data Science with R and Big Data.” Before Starting the review I will like to tell you about my technical background. At the time of joining the course I had around 3 years of experience as Oracle PL/SQL Developer.
After reading and listening much about analytics I finally decided to look for Institutes that provides courses in Analytics. If you search on google you will find Jigsaw on top 5. Before going to Jigsaw I Checked Online fee structure of various institutes for big data course. Mainly Fee structure varied from 25K to 30K Max. But when I went to Jigsaw I was surprised to hear the fee structure that was costing almost 2 to 2.5 times what other institutes were charging. I asked them the reason for this and the guy said the quality of assignments, videos and dataset set they provide for work are really good.
Please not the point that the fee structure I am talking about is for self-learning Course, which means you will be provided with a set of videos of each topic which you have to see and give assessments after each topic. If you go for Instructor led course which means you have a live class with the tutor once in a week that will cost you very high. Please note the course fee is not fixed and it depends how much you can bargain or any offer they provide.
After thinking a lot I went for Combination of 2 Courses Data Science with R and Big Data Course. After negotiation finally the guy offered me the course for 56K. Course validity was for 1 year.
Now I will give you little Introduction about Each Course.
Data Analytics with R: In this Course you will be learning About Machine Learning Techniques and how to implement it to solve business problems. The Course start with very basic and covers all the topics that you need to learn to be a Data Analyst. This is a new thing if you are not from statistics background. You have to be very patient and hard working to learn Data Analytics.
Big Data: I will say this course is best suited for Database related people, as it has DB Concepts involved into it. I would recommend people who are working in Database to go for this course instead of going for combination of both. This course covers almost all the topics involved in Big Data Concepts.
Please Note after completion of course you will stand somewhere between basic and intermediate level for the course you are learning. This level can Change depending on your practice and hardwork.
Placements: Here comes the most important part. Will I get a job after completing the Course? Well it depends on various factors. You’re Salary, Experience, whether company is willing to take a student only with Certification but no with hands on Experience.
Most of the Companies that comes to Jigsaw are startups. Few big names also came like OFSS, Genpeck etc. I have given 2-3 interviews from Jigsaw, But the major concern of the companies is whether you have hands on experience of the same in your current role or not.
So Thinking that you will get a job after completion of course is not an easy thing. You have to make sure that you solve some real word problems on different web sites and put in your resume to make sure that recruiter takes interest in you.
In the end I would like to say that Content of Jigsaw is good, but the fee is very high. For the Big data course I checked Eureka videos or some YouTube videos I found similar kind of content on them also. So I felt they are charging high. If you see the Eureka fee structure you will get to know how much difference is there.
So far I have not got a job on the course I did. The two reasons I felt is:
1.)	No Hands on Experience in my current role.
2.)	Current Salary.
All the best.",3
Sowmiya Sekar,"I enrolled for the Full Stack Data Science(FSDS) program in Jigsaw Academy. My overall experience was good . Staffs in Jigsaw well supported & provide resolution for each query regarding course topic and doubts. The video content is very much useful and the concepts are clear. In boot camp you'll be getting hands-on experience that helps us alot. We will be getting job notification regarding the openings right from the beginning of the course. The support team helps us alot. Especially I would like to thank Mr.Giri for being more helpful throughout this program.

I would recommend you to go for Jigsaw Academy boot camp program.

Thank you Jigsaw Academy and Support team !",5
Amit Patil,"I had enrolled for the Foundation Analytics (SAS) course in Dec 2013. As far as pedagogy, course content and delivery is concerned Jigsaw Academy is definitely top-notch. The instructors were extremely prompt in their email responses to queries and doubts. If you diligently complete the mandatory assignments, there is no doubt that you will gain a solid foundation in Statistics and Analytics techniques as well as good, functional familiarity with programming languages and tools.
If I have to nitpick, the only disappointment was not having lifelong access to the course notes and assignment solutions, but I believe that issue has been fixed now.
I would definitely advise any mid career professionals seeking to switch to Analytics related roles to surely connect with Gaurav or Sarita to understand which course options would be ideal for them.

Chirag Suthar,"Very poor service,along with me and my friends registered this course of more then 50k INR but not worth to join specially who want to know the in and out of big data and data science. There are other good training institute like Coursera, simplylearn would be better then this program style. I`d not recommend this course for fresher who simple need more package to switch their career to analytics, secondly its not worth joining for working professional who are expecting to freeze their course in  between as Jigsaw only gives self learning video once you are out of continuous session series out from your assign batch. The video access is not a life time, you have to pay for the videos once your course duration is expire, Be aware!",1

There is also a Super Good guy called Moses who is a multi tasking person handling so many programs and people at a time.U ask for anything and Moses is ready to help you..All the best to them and proud to be associated with them.,5
Kamraj Subramanian,All i can say about Jigsaw Academy is if you wish to learn then they are ready to provide you with anything to make you intellectual and happy.The customer service is better than any other analytic  institution in business right now which encouraged me to initially get into the academy. The coursework offered allows me to learn at my own pace while i'm working too.Although i studied in one of the best institutions in my place and is highly ranked in my state Tamil Nadu i didn't get the kind of quality education which these people provide here.The coursework is very interesting and we are only taught to deal with real word problems with convoluted assignments to solve.Right now i'm done with half of my coursework and i was really surprised to get a call from my mentor who was very much unhappy as i didn't call or mail him to get any kind of help.I'm sure you will get your money's worth as well as gain some very good analytically skills once your done with your coursework.As a add on i heard the institution is also working with the placement of students.Hope you all have a great time getting into Jigsaw Academy and gaining knowledge.Happy Learning!! And for me i'm planning to take all the courses as they are very interesting :) cheers bubyeee :D,5
Isaac Neduri,"i ve  been with jigsaw enrolled into data scientist and retail analytics, i found that the tutors are very supportive and intuitive. the course content is so well organised even though i'm totally new to the subject i never had any difficulty in learning, with the virtual class rooms one can replay the class session if any question arises besides there is always a support team to handle all the concerns

Thanks to the Jigsaw Team for their constructive coaching and excellent support. above all for making learning analytics affordable and simple ---- Cheers Guys",5
Shruti Mukundan,"I just finished my Full Stack Data Science course at Jigsaw. The course content is really thorough and they provide a good mix of datasets to practice on. I did feel like the in-person classes were rushed due to lack of time, but overall I learnt a lot from the course. They give you a lot of real life analytics exposure.",4
Pooja Joshi,"As I was looking to get back to career life after a couple of year's break, i was keen on choosing a career in analytics. After a lot of research on google, i landed up at Jigsaw Academy. I have enrolled with ""Analytics for beginners"" ""Data science with SAS"" ""Data science with R"".The courses are well structured and the standard of assignments and case studies are based on real life and well framed. Indeed a great learning experience !!!",4
Mangesh Dhakate,"Recently, I completed my FSDS program from Jigsaw Academy.  Firstly, I had tried to learn on my own by watching multiple videos on Youtube and other sites. But it was difficult to get a flow. Finally, In Jigsaw, I got the excellent content to learn Data science and that too in a step by step approach.",4
Dinesh M S,"The foundation course is very focused on training students on application of tools and concepts, which I found very useful once I started working. The trainers are all highly experienced and therefore they understand industry requirements and are a good source to get interview leads. Provided we put in our efforts, there is a lot to take away from the foundation course @ Jigsaw!!",5
Kavitha Kavi,"It is a good Institute.

I did the basic course which was the “Bootcamp - Data Science” which was a classroom course .

They will teach you the tools like R , Python , SAS and Tableau .

Only R and Python will be taught in the classroom.

SAS and Tableau are self paced learning through online.

They also supported us with extra classes.

The faculty members were good and trained us well with lot of examples in the classroom session. The student Engagement team interacted with me continuously and helped me out finish the assignments on time .

The Bootcamp has an added benefit of IBM Certification.

There are more of Online Courses.

There are plenty of courses which is helpful to upgrade ourselves at different stages of our career.

Overall it is a good course for all kinds of people from students to working Professionals who want to upgrade themselves in analytics field .",4
Praveen Paliwal,"It is one of the best online institute to start your career in data science and machine learning which cover all the aspects required to work in predictive analytics.

Bhargav RK,"Hi, My name is Bhargav and a proud student of Jigsaw Academy, A place where you can look for the best career and opportunities in Analytics.

Trust me, they provide the skills exact way the industry looks for, its not just teaching they groom the student at par to the level of competency in the industry. A basic learner can easily understands the level of language and techniques.

Jigsaw Academy also supports each student methodically and take my words this is the place one should invest money to learn for growth.

I would like to thank Jigsaw team especially Gaurav, Sarita and my friend Moses for their extended support.

Thanks

dheeraj kasar,"I am one of the student enrolled for a combo course at Jigsaw Academy.

I am writing this for thanking Jigsaw Academy. I especially wanted to thank the faculties and support team for the follow ups and quick replies to my queries. Moses Kola has been a very supportive program coordinator from day 1 and have answered my calls at late night also. I have also been able to interact with Roopa once and she was very clear about her comments on my resume and guided me.I have had a very positive experience with Jigsaw Academy.",5
Shuvayan Das,"My interest in analytics was mainly because I was looking for a change of field from IT.I was planning for higher education(MBA to be specific) and took up the course just to learn something new.Little did i know that it would grasp my interest so much that I would decide to make my career in it.
All thanks to Jigsaw.You can do free courses available all over the internet,but I can promise you that no one will teach you like Jigsaw.It is like you are taking your first steps and somebody is there to hold you and guide you until you grow knowledgeable and good enough to take on this exciting field.

""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.""
Albert Einstein

This is absolutely true for the faculty at jigsaw.The field is complex and it is not easy to explain the concepts in a way that everyone can understand,but the faculty at Jigsaw does just that.The support is exceptional from all quarters.
It will make you ready to enter the field of analytics and give you a solid foundation for that.
I am really grateful to Jigsaw for showing me this new path and helping me decide on my career direction.
Kudos and keep up the great work.!!",5
Ramesh Kumaran N,"I have enrolled for 4 courses in Jigsaw Academy. The course content is designed in such a way to give the overall understanding of the particular course. With many real time examples given in class videos and hands-on lab session makes it a great deal to learn analytics from Jigsaw Academy.

The course content is provided with pre-class videos and pre-class materials which covers almost all the basic things needed for that particular class (Both Web based & Instructor led classes).

The faculty for the courses are knowledgeable and the interaction with faculty & support team is seamless in getting the issue resolved (whether it is related to subject/topic or general support). It just doesn’t stop with videos and materials. The Case Study will make us utilize all the knowledge gained and understanding the topics learnt. The case studies are designed in such a way to give the real-time experience in Analytics. The Forum or Discussion board makes the students to interact among themselves.

I would say that anyone who can sufficiently devote 2-3 hours per day or a minimum of 10 hrs per week can complete the course on time balancing the professional and personal duties.",5
saikumar rachamalla,"Hi, please give your sincere feedback regarding this Academy, because i'm totally confused with the below reviews. I'm a non-programmer guy with good academics who would like do an Analytics Course (R, SAS and Python) from Jigsaw Academy. I have six years of experience in Aerospace industry, currently working with one of the Indian MNC, kindly let me know if Jigsaw is the right place to learn analytics with zero programming knowledge. Is it okay if I go with the pre-recorded room training or for a non-programmer guy like me needs an Instructor led training?? I have the ability to understand the things fast...
Expecting a faster response...and thank you all...",1
sourya bhattacharya,"I am presently pursuing Advanced Data Science with SAS & R from Jigsaw Academy. The course is well-designed covering the important statistical and analytical concepts in details. The concepts are well explained with  practical case studies which makes it easier to understand and relate. I definitely find this course adding value to my career and people interested in craving their career in the analytical domain will definitely undertake the course not only for value addition, but also for knowledge enhancement.",5
Ravindra Singh Suri,"I am  a student of Jigsaw, Jig15051 is my ID.

Education: All are recorded videos but the good part is you get opportunity to work in a SAS and R platform through remote connection. coming to Interview questions and capstone project, they ask to refer books but I don't know what is the use of Jigsaw  if we refer books.

Placement: Asked to complete the courses  to refer any company. before this they ask to apply for Internships which cannot be shortlisted. The beauty part is they send the naukri and IIM job portals vacancies on SAS/R/Python

This is the true fact of Jigsaw.

But 42k is not worth for Jigsaw if we compare to other institution or Udemy.",1
Bezalel Justus,I have completed few courses in Jigsaw Academy. Analytics for Leaders is one of the best course I have done in Jigsaw which suits for Middle level Managers and Management executives. The explanation of real time case studies was awesome which covers the Various business domains of the industries. Hats off to you JIGSAW !!!,5
Shyamalima “Shyamalima” Baruah,Doing the Foundation Course at Jigsaw Academy was a fantastic experience.  The programme is very well designed to combine statistical concepts with analytic techniques using the language of SAS.  The course provides a framework within which one can develop his/her thinking on any key analytic business challenge with a view to identifying the right solution.,5
Vasu Bandla,"The entire Boot camp program has been interesting and done with the two-way communication mostly in all the situations. The concepts covered in the program is helpful for us to start a great career in the field of data science. Giving more practice sessions will help students to understand more. They explain the cases where how to
implement the concepts in job locations.",4
shubhranshu s,"Jigsaw Academy is the best place to learn analytics. Even the difficult topic can be learnt in the easiest way with the help of pre-calss videos,real case studies and high class faculties from

I have completed my post graduate on cloud computing from manipal University.

Amul Badjatya,"I was already working in analytics (Mu Sigma) when I joined Jigsaw. My intention was to sharpen my skill set and learn things ahead of the curve from people who had been there and done that for over 10 years.
Gaurav and Sarita are great mentors and extremely responsive. Not only did I sharpen my technical and problem solving skills under them ,by joining Jigsaw I had entered an ecosystem- where Gaurav/Sarita and my other peers at Jigsaw were a forum I could look up to when I wanted to deliver something better at my work and needed guidance.
It gave me an opportunity to utilize the ""crowd wisdom"" of this set of people containing experienced biggies like Gaurav/Sarita but also my parallels who working else where in analytics. Overall, if you want to get into analytics/ do well in analytics - don't look at Jigsaw as just one course- look at it like joining an ecosystem. This ecosystem will help you drive your growth in analytics for years to come.",5
Umang Chugh,"I have attended two analytics courses on Coursera before this course and there is no comparison between MOOCs and Jigsaw Academy's course.  it is miles ahead.

Here are the things I liked -
1. I found that being able to chat with the faculty through the day was very helpful. I took their help whenever I got stuck anywhere.
2. The quality of videos is pretty good as well.
3. The virtual lab is the most useful part of the course. I enjoyed working with business data here.

Things I didn't like -
1. I found the pace to be hectic. i was expected to put 8 to 10 hours every week which was difficult for me.
2. the ""chat with instructors"" option was very very helpful. But it was introduced towards the end of my course. :(. This feature makes the course even better.
3. The access to videos is limited to 6 months. I t will be better to get lifetime access.",4
Balaji Sreedhar,"Just completed my Data Science with SAS certification with Jigsaw and found the course to be quite helpful. The recorded sessions are of good quality and the remote access to the lab, at any time from anywhere is a big plus.

Satish Kumar,"My experience at Jigsaw Academy has truly been a remarkable one so far.

biju nair,"Well....To Start with - I take this opportunity to thank the entire Jigsaw Academy Team.

I have enrolled myself for the Combo Course (Data Science with SAS + Financial Analytic - Instructor Led).  My journey and association with Jigsaw  has been an AWESOME Experience So Far !!!!

I was really very skeptical before enrolling for the Course, but as I progressed into my course... I am have realized my true potential that this course has brought out in me.....

COURSE CONTENT:  Extremely well rounded, business oriented, practical, and relevant to the current business scenario/challenges.  Assignments are challenging ...one needs to a lot of logical thinking to come out with the best possible solution for a given set of problem.

FACULTY:   The domain knowledge of the facilities is of top notch quality, having vast experience in analytical industry....the ensure that we get the concept right and if not, they go extra mile to explain the same using robust examples

SUPPORT TEAM:  Highly professional.  They have always been there to answer any queries that I shoot up to them.  I get immediate reply via chat or through e-mail be it a technical issue or otherwise...they have guided me through all the instances.

LMS:  Easy to navigate and user friendly, highly interactive.

OVERALL IMPRESSION:  I am extremely happy to be associated with Jigsaw and I do look forward to enroll myself for more courses on offer from Jigsaw....I would strongly suggest people wishing to chose analytic as their career to seriously think of learning it through Jigsaw !!!!",5
Uday Choudhary,"I enrolled in Jigsaw's ""Full Stack IoT Program"". I have completed the first half of the course with certification from Jigsaw. It can be verified in my LinkedIn profile. I am extremely pleased that I made the decision to learn about IoT from here as compared to anywhere else. The reason being that every theoretical concept is complemented with a hands-on practical implementation along the way. The hardware needed for all the projects was provided within days of enrolling in the course. There are capstone projects at the end of every module which accumulate the knowledge learnt over the entire module. The faculty is excellent in clearing doubts in a clear manner and more importantly in a timely manner which is important for any online training course. They went beyond what might have been required for clearing doubts and explaining concepts, providing links for further reading if required. The faculty contact according to our timing as I have a working job as well. The technical team have always responded by fixing any issue which arose within a few hours and sometimes within less than an hour. All that being said, the real strength of Jigsaw's IoT program lies in the fact that it exposes the student to so many new technologies which are necessary to understand and implement in the IoT eco-system other than the core domain knowledge; even if they might appear as not being relevant immediately. Such technologies are the MEAN stack, Blynk mobile app, containers(Docker), TICK stack, facial detection, speech recognition,  AWS's EC2 instance for cloud to name a few. There is also documentation for reference for all the practicals. That being said, it is up to the student if they want to dive deeper into each topic on their own time. There are also workshops for each module which augment to the knowledge further.  IBM Watson is introduced in one such workshop. The placement team update the student forum with up-to-date job listing which are relevant for the IoT domain. The course is well-designed may it be graphics for visual style of learner or description for verbal style of learner. The graphics and the icons meant to communicate concepts are unlike anywhere I have ever seen in any presentation or video.  They immediately make the concept stick as a image in the mind; which is very helpful to recall later. The depth with which they were designed is indeed marvellous. Not many pay such attention to such minor details; unless it is Apple Inc.",5
Subhrajyoti Mallick,"I am a 2018 B.tech - IT graduate and immediately joined an MNC just after I  completed my university degree. The firm I joined in was just to be in the rat race of being into the corporate once I am graduate. Soon I realised that I have much more in terms of ability, which I was certainly not able to explore and excel in that job. So I chose to step out of that firm.
I wanted to join an organisation that would help me brush my skills in a way that I emerge out to be more corporate fit. And also I get to enrich myself more in the areas of my technical interest, so that I may further be able to work on those areas specifically.
Then I came across ""Jigsaw Academy"" in internet. To get a better insight about the course and curriculum of this academy, I got in contact with
Mohammed Azeemulla M S, Support Team. Having discussion with him, I could figure out that the course called, PGPDM - 2019, could help me achieve my career goals in the best possible ways. I have continuously been in touch with him and have been helped regarding all the doubts I had.
Now that I have joined the academy, I feel quite confident that I shall be able to come up with vibrant colours in the years in ahead of mine in the corporate.",5

I was searching for a good Iot course as I wanted to learn more about it and find my career in the field.

Preetham Rao,"Jigsaw Academy is a great place to Learn Analytics. I previously have ha no experience in Analytics and as a field it really interested me. I did a lot of research and finally zeroed in on 2 institutes in Bangalore for a course on Analytics( My main interest was SAS). After speaking to a few people, I realized Jigsaw was the place to be. Even on doing a good amount of comparisons online(One comparison was between Jigsaw and IIM-B) , I decided that Jigsaw was the institute to enroll for. Though the other option was much more cheaper, at the end of the day, you always select the place from where you could be better off in the future than sooner!
The faculty quality is nothing short of exceptional! Fabulous, Experienced, practical as well as a very good hands-on approach to each topic. Especially, considering that SAS is a programming language, a hands-on approach is almost inevitable and this is what makes Jigsaw stand out! Sarita: probably the Best Analytics Prof! You could teach a nation Analytics!! Shilpa Jat: Thank you for constatntly replying to my incessant number of doubts in the assignments!! You have constantly supported and helped me with my issues and topics! Thank you very much!!
The support is another brilliant team. Every time I've had issues, they have responded positively as well as promptly! To cite an instance , I was facing an issue while connecting to a Remote Desktop. It was a lazy Sunday Afternoon and I sent a mail to the Support. I immediately(< 5 mins) received a reply which sent me a step-by-step procedure to sort out the issue and I was back to my assignments! Thank you Moses, Ramesh and the Team!!
Overall a great institute! A great future to a great start-up!!",5
JERIL JOSEPH,"I wouldn't suggest jigsaw, infact i don't think even a single star is eligible for jigsaw academy. As a student of Jigsaw, what i can say is
1) The presentations are very bad, infact the presentations are elementary level and when it comes to assignments, its so damn complex that we wont be able to solve it. But very pathetic material, and that's the objective of jigsaw academy, because historically students have found it difficult to complete the course barring a few and jigsaw guys knows it too, and over the course of all this complications our access period to the material too gets over making us at loss

2) They charge so high almost every course, which is not worth even a single penny. Because once the money is paid ball is in their court and they are least bothered.

3) I have had pretty bad experience with the faculty. I mean this is my personal experience.

Kindly think and enroll here, because if i sum-up i can tell this about jigsaw. Heavily priced courses with primitive level of materials and u landing up not completing the course because u need to complete 70% of assignments to get certificate, not worth it taking up in jigsaw. For all the guys out there, kindly think and take up jigsaw, infact there are better places out there with good prices along with better materials and faculty support.",1
Arjun R D,"The course content for Data analytics with SAS is really good and really helpful. Lot of good real-life case studies.

Venkatesh Vanjaku,"It was one of the best training that I have attended so far. The two important things that you should have, to succeed and sustain in this domain are desire and passion

Checkout the course modules first, you will receive hands on practice in almost all the concepts. Industry experts will be training and monitoring you in this course.

Nothing in this world is perfect, you might have ups and downs while learning or practicing, just NEVER GIVEUP. Worrying abou job? Nobody in this world can guarantee a job for you, if you don't have self-confidence and subject knowledge. Don't worry, if you don't have a technical degree/ experience, it doesn't really matter. You can still learn and grab a job with decent package.

Be prepared for everything, everyday will be like a challenge. Focus to what you interested more in this course, and gain knowledge on all other concepts.

Note: This is neither an endorsement nor recommendation by me for Jigsaw Academy. Purely personal experience.",4
Saptarishi Sengupta,"Being an economic graduate i tried in various government projects,institutions,kpo s etc. When i reached there i realized that i lack analytical skills and to deal with raw data i have to learn these analytical tools.

Faculty ,support team,technical team are very supportive and always available at the click of the mouse.Though the course is difficult but due to constant efforts of the faculty it looks very easy.The case studies and assignments are comprehensive and realistic.Doubt sessions are very helpful to further the understanding of concepts.The entire course structure is designed in such a way that it enables a fresher to pick up the ABCs of analytics.Because of JIGSAW now i can handle and understand raw data and can play with numbers to derive some conclusions.Hope to reap rich dividends in future on completion of this course .",4

Venkat Aditya,"I had a great acquisition experience with Jigsaw academy. Their course content is truly awesome. Faculty are expertness on the theme they've Blackbeard us by using real-prison term examples. At every instance they are there for us no topic it's a weekend or a vacation too. If in future Jigsaw come up with a course on ""How to provide table serving to the client's"" or ""Service to the Customer Analytics"". I would be the first person to enroll into the course. Their service is truly extraordinary(Mosses & Ramesh - Daily jobs mails, tips,form residual ).

Statement to define Jigsaw service:
""If customers gets 99 meter s goodness service and 100th meter it's ok or bad service customers remembers last service only. So, every time customer should be delighted with the service maybe it's an 99th time or 199th time. Jigsaw bandstand on this pedigree no issue what. I truly appreciate the Jigsaw Academy team for providing such an platform for individuals & professionals to learn. I wish them to reach tiptop of Everest.",5
Nik K,"I did the Data Scientist course from Jigsaw Academy in 2013.
A very hands on and affordable course, with a power packed course content covering the entire value chain of analytics, right from an overview of analytics, a thorough grounding in the basics of statistics, detailed instruction on advanced statistical techniques like logistic regression, decision trees, clustering and big data analytics.

A step-wise and easy to learn training methodology for mastering the R platform, a platform which is inherently not known to be very user friendly.

I would recommend this course to anyone seeking a thorough grounding in the basics of business analytics.",4
Vivek Yadu,"I have worst experience enrolling my self one of data science courses. They just bother about money. Once you paid the fees after that they won't care about you. I paid 51,000 INR . It was total waste. In name of online service they provide junk material and moreover also some time it wont work. If you call their customer service desk they won't pick your phone.  they also do false promise on placement assistants. So be care full while enrolling your self with Jigsa.  There are other good institute in the same line of business.",1
Yashodhan Bhatt,"Job Prospects : I was recruited because of a course I completed at Jigsaw.

Pros : (1) Excellent Content (2) Hands-On experience with near to real life business case studies
(3) Helpful Faculty

Cons : (1) Less importance on doubt clearance (2) Lack of actual classroom sessions & only digital interaction with batch mates tends to make you procrastinate

Overall Review : A good choice for anyone who wants to switch over to analytics and/or is entirely new to the world of analytics.

Things to keep in mind : (1)  Even though they don't say it, the student is expected to have some statistical base already. 'R For Dummies' book & certain MOOCs at eDX filled in all the blanks where Jigsaw failed. (2) Apply for the job only after you've completed at least one course from Jigsaw.",4

Lohith Loki,"They are just another greedy institute, won't even give 10% of what they promised after paying the fee. I prefer you to talk with the students who have been to this institution before you join. You will never join the institute and I'm sure that you will thank me for this 😂. To have a clear review on them look into mouthshut.com reviews(150+), over here(50+ revies) they ask their students to give a 5star with a good content of review some of them will and some of them won't.

Reply for what you commented :- The Phases was not taken in-person, stop lying and calling it as false allegations. As you stated that you changed the faculty due to covid-19, Government of India didn't place any rule stating that Israel's faculty can't teach Indian students on an online platform due to covid-19. If your reply was true then I even spoke with the batch 1 students (which was held almost 3months prior to covid-19 pandamic), they also told me about how you guys changed the instructors. Coming back to the feedback, I'm also in the same batch and have friends in it too. I know what the feedback is 🙄.
And I didn't post this review for a refund. I wanted to let know the people about the service your institute provides. I am 100% okay with my statement that the course was not delivered even 10% of what you guys promised. If you think what I posted is not true and making false allegations on your institute then you can legally take action on me.
Thanks,

R Suraj Kumar,"Training with Jigsaw was an out and out learning experience....

Every class there was something new ,different and interesting to learn.

Barely had heard about a term called analytics and then after researching a lot I realized the school for it was Jigsaw........

Came across it when my career was hanging in tenterhooks......Pursued this course whose foundation and basics helped me prepare myself for job trials and walkins and helped me secure one .

Dedicated faculties (Nidhi Maam,Shilpa Maam,Savinder Maam) , Placement support team (Ms.Roopashri and Co) ,Real time industry based curriculum introduced by Sarita Maam and Gaurav Sir, amazing support team(100% dedicated efficient effort from them)  made my course a smooth journey helped me to learn SAS,Excel ,Statistics etc very well.....

Would surely suggest it to students interested in undertaking a career in analytics to go for it for a strong foundation.

Go for it.Take every class seriously with commitment and effort.Prepare well.

Have the right attitude and Mindset.

Remember that Success Happens When Opportunity Meets Preparation.",4

Roopa Kumari,"To be able to mention Jigsaw in one line

“People who are Passionate / Love what they do”

One can witness the above statement from the first time you have interacted with Jigsaw. More evidently their flair for Analytics and their in-depth knowledge reflects on the course content.
Though I’m not from Maths/Statistics background I find the pre-class videos very easy to understand and grasp. It was quite a surprise to get lots of supplementary materials (ALL FREE DOWNLOAD) and case-study scenarios from real-time business. If you have the flair to learn Analytics, then Jigsaw is the right place for unlimited knowledge treasure.
About our Trainer for HR Analytics, Ms. Subhashini Tripathi, who has rich expertise in HR Analytics and shares/teaches from real world business scenarios on challenges faced by HR on data and how to tactfully handle and predict data. The classes were very interesting, thought-provoking and absolutely wonderful.  Hats Off to you Ms. Subhashini Tripathi.
The Support Team is just awesome, you write a query, have a problem in accessing remote desktop (lab sessions) their response time is real quick.
From my experience with Jigsaw, if you want to learn ANALYTICS, learn from the EXPERTS at JIGSAW.",5
pankaj agarwal,Jigsaw academy provided the right mix of theoretical and practical concepts  for a beginner in data science and analytics.The live class recordings are awesome to get practical insights on how data science is applied to real world problem . Thank you jigsaw for providing the right curriculum to get my data science learning,5
Anit Antonito,"Really expensive and courses are not worth of it. Learners note that they are only offering 100% placement assistance. And the worst part is that most of the analytics companies do not consider those who don't have experience. Also their topics are not enough to acquire a career in analytics. Still if you are planning to do analytics, my opinion is that go for R programming or python, not for SAS.",1
Madan Kartheessan,"I am a student doing a course titled ""Data Science in R and SAS."" Student support executives Naveen and Chandan have provided me all the assistance I asked for. In fact, Naveen used to call me every week regarding the status of my course and he also told me that to complete SAS before starting R. The support you get from JIgsaw Academy team is  simply superb. Best wishes for Naveen and Chandan and the support team. This is not a fake review.",5

Avishek Adhikary,"My jigsaw id is Jig14258.......

This is very disappointing to tell you if some one invested Rs 47k and not able to continue with the learning and wants to resume the course , there is no facility as such.
And the solution is your people asking me to do is to rejoin again with another Rs 50k investment which I have got to know today after trying from 28 feb 2020 to 06 May 2020 in watsapp support.....
Rather give me access to R& Python only with in that purchase if you not able to give me all 4 course's access and let me complete it, but another investment is not possible for me as I am one of those who badly hit in this pandemic situation...
I was not able to continue with the courses when I joined as because I had to travel around West Bengal for My Job to run my family.
Please request you do business with humanity, its time to change.

Thanks.",1
Saurabh,Jigsaw Academy is the best institute for analytics program in India. I presently enrolled in IPBA program Batch B6 of it which is offered in joint collaboration with IIM Indore. The faculties are very good in their subject and highly Qualified. Jigsaw faculties have tremendous knowledge about their subject and they also have great hands on the Industrial project. During the course you will get access to jigsaw learning portal where you will get the  material for your course  . Most important person in our program is Moses Kola  (IPBA batch B6) who helps and guide you all through your program. At the end of the course you will get hands on to some Analytics project from Industry which is very good for Analyzing what you have studied in the course.,5

saikat roy,this institute only good for study not good for any work placement after completing the course. For short term courses they dont put any for for placing the student into industry no preparation class or practices. total waste of money if some one will go for short time courses. Also after paying that much money they dont give lifetime acess to courses in future if some one need to revise any thing they will not able to do after 18 month.,1

All the best!!",4
Jaspreet singh,"Don't fall for this institute. These people are very unprofessional.Earlier,I had a positive image of this institute, however, the desperateness of  their counselors shows that all they care about is money.They even say that now is the best time to learn data since because of high paying job.I wonder is money is all we need? in an other words :Is the only unique selling point of the course is money?

I wanted to go for this course as it doesn't require you to have a high end computer to work with huge data as the institute has cloud based platform that allows you to work on data even on a low performing system.I also saw the value that it has made the course for great lake college so it must have some quality content and authoritative knowledge about the data field.I was almost all set to enroll unless over the past few weeks I called insofe and changed my mind to go for certification course with them that's when the true color of this institute came out.The rep was curt and she wasn't as nice to me as she was earlier.She could have pitched me her university of Chicago  certificate course,however, she was so pissed off that covert anger and target driven attitude became apparent.I felt very bad with the conversation I had with her.I even sent an email to the institute, telling them act rationally and professionally and that don't make your counselors act like typical business developers , however,I didn't get any response from them.Not even an acknowledgement.That says a lot about this institute.An educational institute that doesn't even believe in open written communication how can they fulfill the they promise made while enrolling student.I won't talk about the content as I have not studied at jigsaw but definitely what good are content when the approach is unprofessional.",1

On the flip side, it is quite difficult and cumbersome to work on remote server and LMS. Data is not allowed to be exported outside..not even contest data which reduces the likelihood of participants to work on problems.

From this course I learned the skill that the companies are looking for and i got placed in OYO while doing this program.

Special thanks to Mr. Moses for making the entire flow seamless. I would like to specially mention about him for being an excellent facilitator right from beginning to the end of the course.
